# Data-Science-Role-Take-Home-Test
This repo holds all queries, datasets and relevant documentation for the take home piece of my application.

The 3 sections of the test can be found in the following files:

    - This file holds the query to answer section one of the test.
    - It has no dependencies and can be imported straight to a Snowflake worksheet to run.
* PYTHON_section_two.ipynb
    - This file holds the query to answer section two of the test.
    - This file can be opened as a Jupyter Notebook. Information of dependencies and packages are described in this file.
* PYTHON_section_three.ipynb
    - This file holds the query to answer section three of the test.
    - This file can be opened as a Jupyter Notebook. Information of dependencies and packages are described in this file.

Datasets are in CSV format, there are 4 of them. These will need to be downloaded and placed in your working directory prior to opening sections 2 & 3
* I cannot upload fullbas as file is too large for github, but I assume you guys will have access to it.
